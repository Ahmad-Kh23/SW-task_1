This repository was created as part of a Git and GitHub workflow exercise.  
It demonstrates the process of repository setup, branching, pull requests, issue tracking, and project management using GitHub.


The repository includes a small Python program (`demo.py`) that acts as a basic calculator.  
It repeatedly asks the user to enter two numbers, adds them, and displays the result.  
The user can continue performing calculations or press `'q'` to quit.

Sample Output:
Enter a number: 5
Enter another number: 7
x + y = 12
Press 'q' to quit or any other key to continue: q

Error handeling:
